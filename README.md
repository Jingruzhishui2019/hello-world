Just a history of selfteaching python.
Selfteaching is a long journey for everyone,
but most of us ignore the significance of this topic.today,
I'm going to use this new/old ability to learn a new skill---using pyhton to program.
Welcome to the new world!


Clear thinking is a very rare thing,
but even just plain thinking is almost as rare.Most of us most of the time do not think at all.
We believe and we feel,but we do not think.

to sum up the reelationship between feeling 
and thinking is the most resonablee and reliable way to test them.
there are three broad catagories of thinking:reflective,creative,and critical.
the focus of this book is on critical thnking. 
the essence of critical thinking is evaluation.
critical thinking ,therefore,maybe defined as the process by which wee test claims and arguments and determaine which have merit and which do not.
In other words,critical thinking is a search for answers,a quest.
Not surprisingly,one of the most inportant techniques used in critical thinking is asking probing questions.
where the uncritical accept their first thoughts and other people's staement aat face value,critical thinking challenge all ideas in this manner:
critical thinking also employs questions to analyze issues.
consider,for example,the subject of values.
when it is being discussed,some people say,"Our country has lost its traditional values" and "there would be less crime,especially violent crime,if parents emphasized moral values,"
critical thinking would prompt us to ask,
1.what is  the relationship between values and beliefs?between values and convictions?
2.Are all values valuable?
3.How aware is thee average person of his or her values?Is it possible that many people deceive themselves about their values?
4.Where do one's values originate? Within the individual or outside? In thought or feeling?
5.Does reducation change a person's values?If so,is this change always for the better?
6.Should parents and reachers attempt to shape chidren's values?
