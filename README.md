Just a history of selfteaching python.
Selfteaching is a long journey for everyone,
but most of us ignore the significance of this topic.today,
I'm going to use this new/old ability to learn a new skill---using pyhton to program.
Welcome to the new world!


Clear thinking is a very rare thing,
but even just plain thinking is almost as rare.Most of us most of the time do not think at all.
We believe and we feel,but we do not think.
